Machine Learning is implemented for the Intrusion Detection system. The innovative
idea for the project was to improve the training accuracy by reducing the overfitting and
classifying it better. Along with that this project does not only tell that there is an intrusion but also tell the intrusion through different attacks and classify them into different
classes.
All the Objectives were achieved and can be verified with the following comparison re-
sults:-
The attack classes are divided into 4 categories and a single normal category depicting no sign of attack. 
These 4 categories â€“
1. DOS
2. Probe
3. R2L
4. U2R
